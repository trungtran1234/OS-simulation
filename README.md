# OS Simulation
This project is a simulation of basic operating system process management functionalities, including process creation, scheduling, and inter-process communication. 
## How to run the simulation:

1. Clone the repository
2. Go to the root folder
3. Build the program by running ```make``` in the terminal
4. Run ```bin/os_sim``` to start the program
5. Use these commands for the OS simulation:

Q	- Simulate a time unit passing. </br>
U	- Unblock the first process in the blocked queue and move it to the ready queue. </br>
P	- Print the current state of the system, including process states and queues. </br>
T	- Terminate the simulation.
